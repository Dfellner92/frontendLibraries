### Render State in the User Interface Another Way

In the `MyComponent` render method, define a `const` called `name` and set it equal to the name value in the component's `state`. Because you can write JavaScript directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in curly braces.

Next, in the return statement, render this value in an `h1` tag using the variable `name`. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for JavaScript) in the return statement.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: "freeCodeCamp",
    };
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    const name = this.state.name;
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>{name}</h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Set State with this.setState

There is a `button` element in the code editor which has an `onClick()` handler. This handler is triggered when the `button` receives a click event in the browser, and runs the `handleClick` method defined on `MyComponent`. Within the `handleClick` method, update the component `state` using `this.setState()`. Set the `name` property in `state` to equal the string `React Rocks!`.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: "Initial State",
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // Change code below this line
    this.setState({
      name: "React Rocks!",
    });
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Bind 'this' to a Class Method

The code editor has a component with a `state` that keeps track of the text. It also has a method which allows you to set the text to `You clicked!`. However, the method doesn't work because it's using the `this` keyword that is undefined. Fix it by explicitly binding `this` to the `handleClick()` method in the component's constructor.

Next, add a click handler to the `button` element in the render method. It should trigger the `handleClick()` method when the button receives a click event. Remember that the method you pass to the `onClick` handler needs curly braces because it should be interpreted directly as JavaScript.

Once you complete the above steps you should be able to click the button and see `You clicked!`.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: "Hello",
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      text: "You clicked!",
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Use State to Toggle an Element

`MyComponent` has a `visibility` property which is initialized to `false`. The render method returns one view if the value of `visibility` is true, and a different view if it is false.

Currently, there is no way of updating the `visibility` property in the component's `state`. The value should toggle back and forth between true and false. There is a click handler on the button which triggers a class method called `toggleVisibility()`. Pass a function to `setState` to define this method so that the `state` of `visibility` toggles to the opposite value when the method is called. If `visibility` is `false`, the method sets it to `true`, and vice versa.

Finally, click the button to see the conditional rendering of the component based on its `state`.

Hint: Don't forget to bind the this keyword to the method in the `constructor`!

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false,
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  toggleVisibility() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      this.setState((state) => ({
        visibility: (state.visibility = false),
      }));
    } else {
      this.setState((state) => ({
        visibility: (state.visibility = true),
      }));
    }
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}
```
